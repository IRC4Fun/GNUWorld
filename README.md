# GNUWorld
Private Sourced version of GNUWorld tailored for **modern** day IRC &amp; the [IRC4Fun](https://irc4fun.net/) network -- appropriately renamed to **GNUWorld+I4F**.

This repository is to manage and track issues publicly so that [IRC4Fun](https://irc4fun.net/) Users, Staff and CService members are kept **up-to-date** and _in-sync_.  Changes thus far, are currently documented at https://irc4fun.net/index.php?page=CService%2FWhats-New

Please do not ask us to provide you with _our_ version of GNUWorld+I4F -- we won't.
