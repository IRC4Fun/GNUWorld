# GNUWorld
Private Sourced version of GNUWorld tailored for **modern** day IRC &amp; the [IRC4Fun](https://irc4fun.net/) network -- appropriately renamed to **GNUWorld+I4F**.

This repository is to manage and track issues publicly so that [IRC4Fun](https://irc4fun.net/) Users, Staff and CService members are kept **up-to-date** and _in-sync_.  

Do not ask us to provide you with our **_enhanced_**, _closed-source_ version of GNUWorld.  We will protect our **bugfixes** and **enhancements** from reaching other communities, _especially Undernet since they treat their contributors like sh&t_.
